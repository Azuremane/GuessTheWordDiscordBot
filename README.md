# Unscramble The Word (discord bot)
That is the bot that will scramble one word from list when someone says !scramble in discord chat.
(you need to add words in words.txt, 1 word/phrase per line)

In discord chat where bot will be allowed to run say
# !scramble

You need to figure out what word it was and write it in chat, if your answer is correct it will ping you saying you unscrambled the word and how much time it took.
If someone else answers correctly, the bot will congratulate them instead, pinging both original user and the one who asnwered 


1. Download python https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/ and install it
